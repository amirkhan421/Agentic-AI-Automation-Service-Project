# Agentic AI Automation Service Project

## Overview
The **Agentic AI Automation Service Project** is an intelligent recruitment automation system designed to streamline the CV screening and shortlisting process. The system analyzes candidate CVs one by one and evaluates them against predefined recruitment criteria such as required job skills, experience, and role-specific instructions mentioned in the job advertisement.

Based on this analysis, the system automatically approves or rejects CVs and manages communication with both candidates and hiring managers.
